\title{Create Fractional Factorial Design Matrix}
\usage{
fractional_factorial_design(num_factors, generators = NULL, levels = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_factors}{Integer. Number of factors in the design. Must be > 0.}

\item{generators}{Character vector or NULL. Generator definitions for fractional
designs. Each element specifies a defining relation like "D=ABC" or "E=-ABD".
Use "-" prefix for negative generators (e.g., "D=-ABC"). If NULL, creates
full factorial design.}

\item{levels}{Integer. Number of levels per factor. Currently only 2 is supported.
For 3+ level designs, see NIST Engineering Statistics Handbook.}
}
\value{
Data frame with 2^(num_factors - num_generators) rows and num_factors
columns. Factor levels are coded as -1 (low) and +1 (high). Column names
are A, B, C, ... (uppercase then lowercase letters).
}
\description{
Generates a two-level fractional factorial design using specified generators
(defining relations) to reduce the number of experimental runs while maintaining
orthogonality and balance.
}
\details{
This function creates 2^(n-p) fractional factorial designs where:
\itemize{
\item \code{n} = number of factors
\item \code{p} = number of generators (defining relations)
\item Design requires 2^(n-p) runs instead of 2^n runs
}

The function supports:
\itemize{
\item Full factorial designs (when \code{generators = NULL})
\item Fractional factorial designs via generator specification
\item Automatic confounding detection and warnings
\item Standard orthogonal encoding (-1, +1)
}

\strong{Generators} (defining relations) specify which higher-order interactions
are confounded with main effects or lower-order interactions. For example:
\itemize{
\item "D=ABC" means factor D is confounded with the ABC interaction
\item This creates a 2^(4-1) = 8-run design from a 2^4 = 16-run design
}

\strong{Confounding} occurs when effects cannot be separated. The function
automatically detects and warns about confounded effects based on the
generators provided.

\strong{Resolution} describes aliasing structure:
\itemize{
\item Resolution III: Main effects confounded with 2-factor interactions
\item Resolution IV: Main effects free, some 2-factor interactions confounded
\item Resolution V: Main effects and 2-factor interactions free
}
}
\note{
\strong{Generator Notation:}
\itemize{
\item "D=ABC" creates I = ABCD defining relation
\item "D=-ABC" creates I = -ABCD defining relation
\item Spaces and "=" are automatically removed for parsing
}

\strong{Confounding Structure:}
When generators create confounding, the function warns which effects cannot
be separated. For example, with generator "D=ABC":
\itemize{
\item Main effect A confounded with BCD interaction
\item Main effect B confounded with ACD interaction
\item etc.
}

\examples{
# Full factorial design: 2^3 = 8 runs
design_full <- fractional_factorial_design(num_factors = 3)
print(design_full)

# Fractional design: 2^(4-1) = 8 runs instead of 16
design_frac <- fractional_factorial_design(
  num_factors = 4,
  generators = "D=ABC"
)
print(design_frac)

# Multiple generators: 2^(6-2) = 16 runs instead of 64
design_multi <- fractional_factorial_design(
  num_factors = 6,
  generators = c("E=ABC", "F=BCD")
)

# Negative generator
design_neg <- fractional_factorial_design(
  num_factors = 5,
  generators = c("D=ABC", "E=-ABD")
)
