\usage{
augment_with_star_center_points(
  factorial_design,
  alpha = "rotatable",
  center_points = NULL,
  add_blocks = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{factorial_design}{Data frame. Output from \code{fractional_factorial_design()}
containing the factorial points coded as -1 and +1.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Distance of axial points from center. Default is "rotatable"
which computes \eqn{\alpha = (n_f)^{1/4}}. Can also be:
\itemize{
\item Numeric value (e.g., 1.414 for 2 factors)
\item "rotatable" (default) - ensures rotatability
\item "orthogonal" - for orthogonal blocking
\item "faces" or 1 - face-centered design (α=1)
}}

\item{center_points}{Integer. Number of center point replicates. Default is
calculated to balance design, typically 4-6 points. More replicates improve
pure error estimation but increase experimental cost.}

\item{add_blocks}{Logical. If TRUE, adds a "block" column to identify factorial,
axial, and center point blocks. Default FALSE.}
}
\value{
Data frame with the augmented design containing:
\itemize{
\item All original factorial points (coded -1, +1)
\item 2k axial points (coded 0 except one factor at ±α)
\item n center points (all factors coded 0)
\item Optional "block" column if \code{add_blocks = TRUE}
\item "point_type" column identifying: "factorial", "axial", or "center"
}
}
\description{
Adds axial (star) points and center points to a two-level factorial or fractional
factorial design to create a Central Composite Design (CCD) suitable for fitting
second-order (quadratic) response surface models.
}
\details{
\strong{Central Composite Designs (CCD)} are the most popular response surface methodology
(RSM) designs for fitting quadratic models. A CCD consists of three components:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Factorial points}: 2^k or 2^(k-p) design from \code{fractional_factorial_design()}
\item \strong{Axial (star) points}: 2k points at distance ±α on each factor axis
\item \strong{Center points}: Replicated points at the origin (0, 0, ..., 0)
}

\strong{Three Types of CCD:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{CCC (Circumscribed)}: α > 1, star points outside factorial cube (default)
\item \strong{CCF (Face-centered)}: α = 1, star points on face of factorial cube
\item \strong{CCI (Inscribed)}: α < 1, star points inside factorial cube
}

\strong{Rotatability}: A design is rotatable when the variance of predicted response
depends only on distance from center, not direction. For rotatability:
\deqn{\alpha = (n_f)^{1/4}}
where \eqn{n_f} is the number of factorial points.

\strong{Orthogonality}: When blocks are used, orthogonal designs allow independent
estimation of model terms and block effects.
}
\note{
\strong{Design sizes:}
\itemize{
\item Total runs = \eqn{n_f + 2k + n_c}
\item \eqn{n_f} = factorial points (8 for 2^3, 16 for 2^4, etc.)
\item \eqn{2k} = axial points (always twice number of factors)
\item \eqn{n_c} = center points (user specified)
}

\strong{Alpha selection guide:}
\itemize{
\item For k=2: α = 1.414 (rotatable)
\item For k=3: α = 1.682 (rotatable)
\item For k=4: α = 2.000 (rotatable)
\item For k=5: α = 2.378 (rotatable)
}

\strong{Rotatability vs Face-centered:}
\itemize{
\item Rotatable designs (α > 1) explore larger region, need 5 factor levels
\item Face-centered (α = 1) need only 3 levels, easier to implement
}

# Example 1: 2^3 full factorial + CCD (rotatable)
factorial <- fractional_factorial_design(num_factors = 3)
ccd <- augment_with_star_center_points(factorial)
print(ccd)
# Total: 8 factorial + 6 axial + 6 center = 20 runs

# Example 2: Face-centered design (alpha = 1)
factorial <- fractional_factorial_design(num_factors = 2)
ccf <- augment_with_star_center_points(

# Example 4: Custom alpha value
factorial <- fractional_factorial_design(num_factors = 3)
